## for loops
expression1 initializes a value 
expression2 tests a condition based on expression2 and expression3
expression3 define the stop condition 
```
for(expression1; expression2; expression3){
	statements
}
```
## While
while the expression is true the statements inside the loop are executed. If the program reaches the loop and the expression is false the statements will no be executed
```
while(expression){ 
	statements;
}
```
## Do While
this loop executes the statements and the test the condition, if the condition is false the statements will be executed again. because of this the statements is executed at least one time, even is the condition on the expression is false from the beginning
```
do{
statements 
}while(expression)
```

## Break and Continue
the break statements is used to exit a loop.
a Continue loop can be used to skip the rest of that iteration.
